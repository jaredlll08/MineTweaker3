Make sure all Collection returning things can actually be used

Make sure all the Level related classes are exposed

expose net.neoforged.neoforge.event.entity.player.PlayerInteractEvent.EntityInteractSpecific

Check Entity and Living Entity on what to expose

expose net.minecraft.world.effect.MobEffect.AttributeTemplate

Look at all the advancement / loot predicates and make sure it is all exposed, maybe throw it all out and redo lol
relook at loot, see how we can make it easier, like have ItemSubPredicates be a bep

loot in neoforge does not work

rename all ZC and docs stuff to make sense

brewing has been disabled for now.

Look at DataComponents and make sure all of them are actually exposed
